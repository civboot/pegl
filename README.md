# PEGL: PEG-like recursive descent Parser in Lua

> WARNING: PEGL is in development and is not yet ready for use.

PEGL is PEG like recursive descent Parser written in Lua.

Recursive descent is simultaniously one of the simplest (conceptually)
parsers while also being the most powerful. PEG is one of the simplest
parser-combinator languages, conceptually implementing a recursive descent
parser with a specific subset of features.

PEGL implements those features as a ultra-lightweight Lua library, maintaining
conciseness while avoiding any customized syntax.
